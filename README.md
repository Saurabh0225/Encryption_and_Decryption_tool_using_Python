# Encryption & Decryption Tool using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Python-based Encryption and Decryption Tool** that allows users to
secure sensitive information by converting plaintext into encrypted ciphertext and
decrypting it back using a secret key.

The tool demonstrates fundamental **cryptography concepts** such as encryption,
decryption, key-based security, and secure data handling.

⚠️ This project is intended for **educational purposes only**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement encryption and decryption using Python
- Protect sensitive data using a secret key
- Understand basic cryptographic principles
- Demonstrate secure data handling in applications

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Cryptography library (`cryptography`)
- Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ How the Tool Works
1. User provides plaintext data
2. A secret key is generated or provided
3. Plaintext is encrypted into ciphertext
4. Ciphertext can be decrypted back using the same key
